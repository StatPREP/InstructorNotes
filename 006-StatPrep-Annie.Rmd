# StatPrep Annie

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

StatPrep Annie is a persona created to depict a real-world StatPREP instructor who is setting up their statistics course.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "StatPrep Annie", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Annie-thumbnail.png")
```

She's got a website for her course, a couple of interactive lessons, and so on.

One way to get a quick start on your own website, lessons, etc. is to copy Annie's project to your own accounts. Then customize it for your own purposes.

## Copying Annie's `StartUsingR` project

1. Using your browser, login to your account on `rstudio.cloud`. The main page for your "workspace" will be displayed.
2. Open a new tab in the browser. Cut and paste exactly this URL into that new tab.

    `https://rstudio.cloud/project/40418`

    Annie's template will be copied into your workspace. It will open with a red "Temporary" in the top line.
3. Press "Save a permanent copy" so that you have your own, fully independent copy of Annie's StartUsingR project.


To transform StatPrep Annie's web site to your own, just edit the `docs/index.Rmd` file in your copy of the project. Chapter [#Your_course_web_site] shows how to publish the website.
