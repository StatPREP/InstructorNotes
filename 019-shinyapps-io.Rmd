## Authorizing rstudio.cloud to publish

You need to authorize `rstudio.cloud` to publish to your `shinyapps.io` account. How do you do this? The general idea is that you login to `shinyapps.io` and ask it to tell you a secret. Then, from `rstudio.cloud`, you send that secret back to `shinyapps.io`. Once `shinyapps.io` knows that `rstudio.cloud` is in on the secret, shinyapps will accept future commands from you `rstudio.cloud` account.

1. Login to your account on `rstudio.cloud`.
2. Open any project on `rstudio.cloud`.
    - From the RStudio interface, select the "Packages" tab and press "Install".
    ```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/annie-install-rsconnect1.png")
    ```
    - In the dialog box that appears, start typing `rsconnect`. At some point, the dropdown menu will show that choice. Click on that and press "Install".

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/annie-install-rsconnect2.png")
    ```
3. Login to `shinyapps.io`. Select the "Dashboard" tab. You'll see a section entitled "Authorize account" with a display of computer code and a "copy to clipboard" button. Press that button. 
    ```{r echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/annie-authorize-cloud2.png")
    ```
    Depending on your browser, you may be asked to press CNTR-C to copy the code.

4. Return to the console in `rstudio.cloud` and paste in the code you copied in (3).



Press the "Publish" button.
    - Select "RStudio Connect"
    - Select "Publish finished document only"
    - In the dialog box titled "Select RStudio Connect Account", type the address `shinyapps.io`.
